            <P>We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with privacy and the Personal Information that we collect through this website.

As used in this Agreement, "FOODWAY," "we," "us," and "our" shall mean FOODWAY SUCCESS ENTERPRISE.</P>

            <P>By accessing and/or using the Sites, you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Sites. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice.</P>

            <P><h4 class="title is-5">Personal Information</h4>
                Information such as your name, tied to a postal address, telephone number, email address, and date of birth, or other data that, when taken together, can uniquely identify you. Personal Information also includes certain sensitive information related to your finances or, for business accounts, related to the finances of your employer, such as a credit card number or other payment account number (including the three (3) or four (4) digit validation code for your credit card). In order for you to take advantage of the services provided through the Sites, we may require that you furnish Personal Information or, for business accounts, that your employer furnish Personal Information for you. We and our third party service providers collect your Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us or, for business accounts, when your employer provides it to us.</P>
            <br>
            <P><h4 class="title is-5">Non-Personal Information</h4>
                Aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not uniquely identify you. We and our third party service providers may collect your Non-Personal Information, including information about the device you are using in accessing and/or using the Sites, information from referring websites, and your interaction with the Sites. We and our third party service providers may also aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end-product does not uniquely identify you or any other user of the Sites, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. This collective information constitutes Non-Personal Information.</P>
            <br>              
            <P><h4 class="title is-5">Location Information</h4>
                We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect. For example, your IP Address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet.</P>
